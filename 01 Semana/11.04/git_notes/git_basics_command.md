# git Basics
## Init a repository
to initialize a repository we have to use the command `git init`
after this command while create hidden `.git` sub-folder in the project folder.

## Track first changes

First time our files are *untracked*
To star tracking our files we have to `commit` them.

For example , if we have an `index html` created we can star tracking ir by doing...

```
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "first commit"
```
