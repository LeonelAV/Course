<h1>Exercise 5 - CSS Layout</h1>

<aside>The above links demonstrate a basic navigational structure using an
unordered list styled with CSS. Use this as a starting point and modify
the properties to produce your own unique look. If you require flyout
menus, create your own using a Spry menu, a menu widget from Adobe's
Exchange or a variety of other javascript or CSS solutions.

If you would like the navigation along the top, simply move the ul.nav
to the top of the page and recreate the styling.</aside>

	<p>Be aware that the CSS for these layouts is heavily commented. If you do
most of your work in Design view, have a peek at the code to get tips on
working with the CSS for the fixed layouts. You can remove these
comments before you launch your site. To learn more about the techniques
used in these CSS Layouts, read this article at Adobe's Developer Center
- <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/adc_css_layouts"></a>http://www.adobe.com/go/adc_css_layouts.</p>
<h2>Clearing Method</h2>
<img src="http://diariodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Desayunos-de-Innovaci%C3%B3n-Roca-Barcelona-Gallery.jpg">
<p>Because all the columns are floated, this layout uses a clear:both
declaration in the .footer rule. This clearing technique forces the
.container to understand where the columns end in order to show any
borders or background colors you place on the nutellabun.container. If
your design requires you to remove the .footer from the .container,
you'll need to use a different clearing method. The most reliable will
be to add a <br class="clearfloat" /> or <div class="clearfloat"></div>
after your final floated column (but before the .container closes). This
will have the same clearing effect.</p>
<h2>Logo Replacement</h2>
<p>An image placeholder was used in this layout in the .header where you'll
likely want to place a logo. It is recommended that you remove the
placeholder and replace it with your own linked logo.

Be aware that if you use the Property inspector to navigate to your logo
image using the SRC field (instead of removing and replacing the
placeholder), you should remove the inline background and display
properties. These inline styles are only used to make the logo
placeholder show up in browsers for demonstration purposes.

To remove the inline styles, make sure your CSS Styles panel is set to
Current. Select the image, and in the Properties pane of the CSS Styles
panel, right click and delete the display and background properties. (Of
course, you can always go directly into the code and delete the inline
styles from the image or placeholder there.)</p>
<h2>Backgrounds</h2>
<p>By nature, the background color on any div will only show for the length
of the content. This means if you're using a background color or border
to create the look of a side column, it won't extend all the way to the
footer but will stop when the content ends. If the .content div will
always contain more content, you can place a border on the .content div
to divide it from the column.

This .footer contains the declaration position:relative; to give
Internet Explorer 6 hasLayout for the .footer and cause it to clear
correctly. If you're not required to support IE6, you may remove it.</p>
